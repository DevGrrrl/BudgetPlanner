# Kitty Splitter :smile_cat:

[Our Kitty Splitting app :)](https://kittisplitter.herokuapp.com/)

## The Project

Kitty Splitter allows users to easily log their household expenses, along with a cost, category and date of purchase. They can then tot up the running total, and see how far off the average amount they are.

__User Stories__

* As a user, I want to be able to easily enter items purchased, and see these immediately displayed on the page
* As a user, I want to be able to see items entered by other members of the household
* As a user, I want to find out how much each member of the household has spent
* As a user, I want to be able to see what the average spend was

## How we Built it
We started with our schema, keeping it as simple as possible whilst capturing information we felt we might need as the project progressed:

We then moved on to planning out our software architecture, and did some detailed mapping of our functions and their intput/outputs.

### Challenges
* One of early issues was limiting the scope of the project, as we felt there was so much we could do with the idea
* We don't have a log in system (yet!) so we worked on the basis that all users were part of the same household which is obviously not ideal...
* In future we want to alter this so groups of expenses are linked to a household/event and usernames are validated etc
* Deploying to Heroku!

### Things we learnt

### Stretch Goals
* Adding a feature where the splitter can tell  users who owes what to whom
